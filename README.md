# Common tools for preparing teaching materials

This repository contains various scripts that can help maintain teaching materials, such as Python courses. To use them, you must add this repository as a Git submodule, for example:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/DurhamARC-Training/common-tools-for-teaching.git common-tools
```

## generate_student_version.py

`generate_student_version.py` is a script that processes Jupyter notebooks for teaching purposes by:

1. Removing all code outputs
2. Removing unnecessary notebook metadata
3. Removing cell execution counts
4. Removing cells with slideshow slide type "notes" or "skip"
5. Making markdown cells non-editable to preserve instructions
6. Modifying code cells with "remove_code" metadata according to specified rules

### Installation

No special installation is required other than having Python installed. The script uses only standard library modules.

### Usage

```bash
# Process a single notebook:
python common-tools/generate_student_version.py --source path/to/source_notebook.ipynb --target path/to/output_notebook.ipynb

# Process all notebooks in a folder:
python common-tools/generate_student_version.py --source path/to/source_folder --target path/to/output_folder

# Show verbose processing information:
python common-tools/generate_student_version.py --source notebook.ipynb --target student_notebook.ipynb --verbose
```

### Command-line Options

- `--source`, `-s`: Source notebook file or folder containing notebooks (required)
- `--target`, `-t`: Target notebook file or folder where processed notebooks will be saved (required)
- `--verbose`, `-v`: Display detailed processing information
- `--help`, `-h`: Show help message

### Working with "remove_code" Cell Metadata

The script supports three modes of code removal in cells with the "remove_code" metadata:

1. **Remove all non-comment code:**
   ```json
   "remove_code": "non-comments"
   ```
   This preserves only comments in the cell while removing all executable code.

2. **Remove code after a specific comment:**
   ```json
   "remove_code": "after:# Start removing here"
   ```
   This keeps all code up to the specified comment marker and removes non-comment code after it.
   Note that spaces after "after:" are automatically trimmed.

3. **Remove all content:**
   ```json
   "remove_code": "all"
   ```
   This removes all cell content, both comments and code, leaving only a newline.

### Setting Cell Metadata in JupyterLab

To set the "remove_code" attribute for a cell in JupyterLab:

1. Open the notebook in JupyterLab
2. Click on the cell you want to modify
3. Click on the Property Inspector icon (â“˜) in the right sidebar, or click on the two cogwheels on the top right
4. Go to "Advanced Tools" section 
5. Add the "remove_code" metadata with one of the supported values:
   ```json
   {
     "remove_code": "non-comments"
   }
   ```
   or
   ```json
   {
     "remove_code": "after:# Start removing here"
   }
   ```
   or
   ```json
   {
     "remove_code": "all"
   }
   ```
6. Be sure to confirm the change by clicking on the green checkmark
7. Save the notebook

### Examples

**Example 1:** Create a student version of a single notebook
```bash
python common-tools/generate_student_version.py --source instructor_notebook.ipynb --target student_notebook.ipynb
```

**Example 2:** Process all notebooks in a course folder
```bash
python common-tools/generate_student_version.py --source Filled_Course/ --target Student_Course/
```

**Example 3:** Get detailed information about the processing
```bash
python common-tools/generate_student_version.py --source complex_notebook.ipynb --target student_version.ipynb --verbose
```

### Notes

- Markdown cells are automatically made non-editable in the output notebook, ensuring that instructions and explanations cannot be modified by students
- Cells with slideshow slide type set to "notes" or "skip" are completely removed from the output notebook
- All code outputs and execution counts are removed to ensure a clean starting point for students
- The script preserves essential notebook metadata but removes unnecessary elements

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error message in a cell like:
```
# ERROR: Comment marker '# This marker' not found in cell
```

This means that the marker specified in the "remove_code" metadata couldn't be found in the cell. Double-check that the marker text exactly matches a comment in your cell.
